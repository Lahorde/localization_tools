# Description
Some tools that helps RTLS setup and real time viewing :
 * `accuracy_precision_loc.py` : plot some live histograms of a tracked device (x,y,z) density probability got from a localization system. Get accuracy and precision.
 
 * 3D viewer that shows anchors spheres when it tracks a device. It also detects zone where trilateration solutions leads to an increased inaccuracy
